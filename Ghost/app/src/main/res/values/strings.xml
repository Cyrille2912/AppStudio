    <string name="first_rules_text">Ghost is a two-player game where players form a word by alternating turns saying a letter.\n\nThis letter is then added on to the end of the current word fragment, if there is one.\n\nThere are 2 ways to lose, one is by forming a word that is longer than 3 letters (ex: "PEAR").\nThe second way to lose is by creating a fragment of a word which cannot become a word (ex: "QZ").\n\nThe goal of Ghost is simply not to lose!</string>
